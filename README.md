gyul is a micro wiki engine for displaying information for the chronica ecosystem.

I often find myself reaching for what I know, when the solution may be overkill. For simple static sites, we don't always need giant frameworks. This is my attempt at creating something small to fulfill that purpose for my [wiki](https://wiki.chronica.xyz).
