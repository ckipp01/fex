## TODO
#### short-term
- [ ] figure out links in current format
- [ ] figure out a way to combine `createElem` and `createAndAttatch`
- [ ] figure out a way to put the template elsewhere
- [ ] put in sensible defaults for all tabs if there are no values
- [ ] create an index of all available keys
- [ ] figure out how I want to do the data visualization 
- [ ] build the data visualization 

#### long-term
- [ ] there is a tons of impure code in here.
- [ ] rewrite the templating system to either not use json or have a more sensible way to deal with it
